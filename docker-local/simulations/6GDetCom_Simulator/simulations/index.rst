Showcases
=========

Various simulation showcases are presented in our simulation framework to validate the effectiveness or evaluate the performance of the concepts and mechanisms designed in WP2 and WP3.
In particular, the impact of packet and processing delay variations can be evaluated using the Packet Delay (PD) and processing delay simulation models presented in Section 2.2 and Section 4.2, respectively.

Currently, the following showcases are available:

   :maxdepth: 3
   :titlesonly:

   baseline/doc/index.rst
   cooperativemanufacturing/doc/index.rst
   edgecloud/doc/index.rst
   timesync/doc/index.rst

The first two showcases focus on the performance of IEEE802.1Qbv scheduling with PDs.
The time synchronization scenario focuses on the performance of time synchronization with PDVs.

Please note that the presented results are preliminary and might change or will be refined until the final deliverable D4.5 Validation Results, which is explicitly focused on the presentation of validation results.
